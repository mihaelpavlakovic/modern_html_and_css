Modern HTML and CSS From The Beggining (Udemy Course by Brad Traversy)

In this repository, you will find HTML and CSS files with explained elements, commented course projects, and much more.

Each section is on a different branch for ease of use. 
The first branch, htmlsandbox focuses on the base HTML knowledge of elements and tags. Each new term is commented on and explained.

As I progress in the course, I will add new branches and codes.
